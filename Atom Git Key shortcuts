After having done all the changes to your file:

STAGE CHANGES
In my case the stage and unstage changes are:

alt + g s (to stage)

alt + g z (to unstage)

(see how to set these keybindings as they are not set by default.)

that means first press alt+ g both
then release and quickly press s (to stage changes)


COMMIT

Insert a message then, to commit to master, press:

alt + g enter

or:
ctrl+ enter

REMEMBER ! you can also first write the commit message and then
stage and so on.
That means you can
alt + g enter

then write the commit message then

alt+g s
to stage the changes

again alt+g enter

and finally

alt+g p
to push


If it says error and that you are behind of your counterpart
you need to pull first the changes from the server



PUSH!
to push you commit to the server press:

alt+ g p
