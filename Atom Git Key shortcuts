After having done all the changes to your file:

STAGE CHANGES
In my case the stage and unstage changes are:

alt + g s (to stage)

alt + g z (to unstage)

(see how to set these keybindings as they are not set by default.)

that means first press alt+ g both
then release and quickly press s (to stage changes)


COMMIT

Insert a message then, to commit to master, press:

alt + g enter

or:
ctrl+ enter


PUSH!
to push you commit to the server press:

alt+ g p
