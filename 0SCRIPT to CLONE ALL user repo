In order to clone all the user repo (private and public) you can use this script

requirements:

1)ssh connection with github enabled
2)Enabled OAuth token

for the 1) first point just see 'SSH settings'

for the 2)

go on github and go to

Settings->Developer settings->Personal access tokens

provide a label and check the box next to 'repo'

click save

 a code will be generate. copy that code(that is the token)
 remember that this will only be displayed Once
 if you need to see again you have to create a new token

Now open your terminal and type:

 for i in `curl -H "Authorization: token [TOKEN]" https://api.github.com/user/repos?per_page=100 | grep ssh_url | cut -d ':' -f 2-3|tr -d '",'`; do git clone $i; done

replace [TOKEN] with your copied token (delete the squared brackets) e.g.

for i in `curl -H "Authorization: token 21381892ydhskvfa" https://a.....

done!

now it will download all the repo of the user!
so nice and easy
