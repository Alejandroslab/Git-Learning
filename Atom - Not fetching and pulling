at the moment the Button Fetch and therefore Pull don't work properly.

to overcome this just use terminal:

this means that if you have done an edit outside of atom you will not be able
to retrieve changes.

therefore

open terminal

go with cd to your repository

cd myrepository

when you are inside your repository just do:

git fetch

Sometimes (and only sometimes) the button 'Fetch' in Atom will become 'Pull'

when this does not happen just type

git pull

to download and sync changes.

when files will be synced they will appear in the project bar of atom (as
this works only like a mirror of what is inside the folders)
