While cloning sometimes seems that atom will not accept symbols in the name of the files

When you will try to clone Atom will indicate which file is impeding to clone
fully the repository.

Therefore you could (easiest way to fix): rename the file in Github
then try to clone

If appears the error

'Cloning not availble in the present state'

you should go to the folder in which you have synced your repository and delete
the folder not synced (it will be empty)

Close and reopen atom

Now clone again and it will work.


Therefore 'Cloning not availble in the present state' basically will appear because you have already
cloned the folder and it is already present in the working directory.
