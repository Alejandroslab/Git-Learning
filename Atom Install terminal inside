Go to preferences

then install and look for 'platformio-ide-terminal'

In settings you can change the terminal.
In Windows it will be by default PowerShell.

You change it with ubuntu if you have Windwos Subsystem Linux.

However, interoperability with Windows is not supported making Ubuntu for Windows 10
not too much useful.

Anyways, you can change PowerShell with 'Git Bash' that comes already installed with Git.

Therefore in settings change the path to:

C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe

and Git Bash will replace PowerShell


there is also a package called 'term2' that seems to run more than 1 terminal side by side
nodejs seems to be needed.

to check if you have nodejs installed in windows open PowerShell and

node -v
