How to use Atom with Githu (EASIEST WAY POSSIBLE)

First download Git for Windows, Mac or linux
Then install Atom editor (It's FOSS)

Then open the Editor press

ctrl+shift+p

type Github clone

Go to github and copy the HTTS url for the repository you want to clone.

Paste the url
click on clone

Atom will ask to connect with your credentials and sync with github

Done!


----

Some basics usage:

Keep open the Git panel on Atom on the right

On the left side keep the repositories open.

You can work in multiple repositories at the same time of course

To commit and push

let's first create a file (shortcut is the key 'A') (remember to not insert
slashes in the name of the file as these will create folders)

Type a name. In case you wish to rename press F2

Put some text for testing

(You can also save your text with ctrl+s)


Now on the Git panel (aka tab) select the repository that you are changing

You will see Unstaged Changes (the file will become also green colored)

click on 'Stage install'

the changes now will appear below in the box 'Staged Changes'

Now you have to insert the Commit message (any text you wish)

Click on Commit to Master!

Now on the right side of the bar there will appear the button
"Push" (instead of "Fetch")

Click on push to push the changes to the server and you are done!!

So wonderful ..
