If you incurr in some problems cloning in Atom when after have set up the SSH connection
firt test the ssh connection:

In windows open Git Bash and type:
ssh -T git@github.com
You may see a warning like this:

> The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP ADDRESS)' can't be established.
> RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
> Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

check that the public key fingerprint coincides:


These are GitHub's public key fingerprints:

    SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8 (RSA)
    SHA256:br9IjFspm1vxR3iA35FWE+4VTyz1hYVLIE2t1/CeyWQ (DSA)

    If it does, then type yes:

Now this message will appear:
> Hi your_username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not
> provide shell access.


DONE! this means that the SSH connection is working.
If you cannot clone in Atom this must be a problem of Atom and not on the establishment of the ssh connection

To cloning anyways you can do it wit Git Bash
copy your ssh link that has this format:

git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git

now go to your desired working folder and clone it typing:

git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git

DONE!
If everything works well and you can see your files it is definitely an Atom problem.

To use this repo on Atom simply open Atom and 'File->Add Project Folder'
Remember! Just add the folder of the repositories and not the parent
e.g parent folder: 'github'
repos: 'Excel' 'Python'
just select the 'Excel' and 'Python' folders

Everything will work! even push and pull as you have correclty set up the ssh connection
