Atom provides a very nice way to manage shortcuts or keybindings
every package will have its own keybinding and you can see them in settings->keybindings
you can even search them by commands as every package will have its own commands

you can open settings quickly with 'ctrl ,' in windows and 'cmd ,' in macOS


Github will have its own commands like 'github:clone' or 'github:commit'

anyways it misses the shortcut to stage all the changes.
the command to do that is 'github:stage-all-changes'

if we search in settings->keybinding we will not find any shortcut but we can create one opening the 'keymap' file (that is a .cson file)

you can access it directly from settinge-->keybindings in the message at the top:

'You can override these keybindings by copying and pasting them into your keymap file'
click on keymap file
now go to the last line of the file and paste this:

'.workspace':
  'alt-g s': 'github:stage-all-changes'

  this will add the shortcut alt-g s to the command 'github:stage-all-changes' (you can set any shortcut you want)

save the keymap file with ctrl +s and you are done! (no need to restart atom)

now if you want to add more shortucts that are related to workspace just add another line below

in this case I want add 'unstage all' shortcut therefore the piece of keymap will be:


'.workspace':
  'alt-g s': 'github:stage-all-changes'
  'alt-g z': 'github:unstage-all-changes'


where the 'unstage all' command will have the shortcut 'alt-g z'

remember! if you have any trouble maybe the command is not correct (as for example the stage command is 'github:stage-all-changes' and not 'github:stage-all' )
or you have overridden another keybinding. to try the keybindgs run the 'keybinding resolver'

you will find it in 'Packages->Keybinding Resolver'

REMEMEBR! THE KEYMAP MUST BE PROPERLY INDENTED:
In this Coffee language this is correct:

'.platform-win32 atom-text-editor, .platform-linux atom-text-editor':
  'f5': 'script:run'

while this is not:

'.platform-win32 atom-text-editor, .platform-linux atom-text-editor':
'f5': 'script:run'

this latter will result in an error as it is not properly indented
