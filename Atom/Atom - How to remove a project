To SAFELY remove a project from project tab

right click then 'Remove Project Folder'

now open explorer, find the folder and you can delete it!

never delete the folder in explorer without removing it from the projects inside atom!
It will produce a constant error like 'Unable to locate project folder' every time you startup atom
