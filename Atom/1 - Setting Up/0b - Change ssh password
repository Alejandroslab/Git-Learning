If you have just one key (very likely):

ssh-keygen -p

It will ask the file in which is the key (leave the path as default if you have just one key or point to the right path)

Then enter the old passphrase

Now type the new one (leaving it empty may be ideal for working with git) and confirm it again

done!

If nothing has been found then you do not have setup ssh correctly 


if you have multiple keys you need to specify the key:

ssh-keygen -p -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa
