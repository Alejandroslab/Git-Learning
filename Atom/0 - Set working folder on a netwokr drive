Let's say that we don't want to store the github repos in the usual and default location

C:\\Users\MyUser\github

we can choose any folder even network folders and even if the path contains spaces
In the case of network folder we must know that windows usually use this syntax:

\\myserver\myfolder

the double slash will not work inside atom but also with bash
therefore it is recomended (but i have not tried to clone with the syntax above) to map the folder

to do that go to 'MyPC' in File Explorer click on 'Computer'  and select 'Connect a network drive'

Select a letter and select your folder

let's say

D:\\myserver\myfolder

now Git Bash will be able to process the cloning inside this folder (i  have not tried with Atom as it hsa some problmes cloning sometimes)

NOTES:
the only thing to know is that cloning but also some operations like copy will be a little bit slower

Also if your server or NAS does have an internal recycle bin then you will not able to delete files
You will have to do by command line (use platformio terminal)

Another thing to notice is that when you edit a file and you want to commit it will be slower when checking changes (in the Git panel
changes will appear slower)
