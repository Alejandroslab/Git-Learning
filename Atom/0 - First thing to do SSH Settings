#First type

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myemail@email.com"

When it asks for 'file in which to save the key' just press enter
Then it asks for a passphrase (if you want to create one). You can skip it just pressing enter again (it will be asked twice)

#Second type:

eval $(ssh-agent -s)

it will ask for the passphrase previously set and it will print something like:

'Agent pid  0029'

#Third,:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

again it will ask for the passphrase previously set.
If you have not put anything it will not ask any password
then will print

'Identity added : ~/.ssh/id_rsa/ etc....'



#Finally you could go to your working (Home) folder enter in the folder .ssh (that is hidden) and open the file
id_rsa.pub
REMEMBER! Open it with 'vi' and not 'nano' as the latter could have some problems viewing the public key
Remember that the public key is very long (more than 6 lines of code)

Copy the code inside the file.

Go to github->settings> SSH and GPG Keys-> click on New SSH Key-> put a title and paste the code of the id_rsa.pub

(the code will begin with 'ssh-rsa...'. Paste it with 'ssh-rsa'. it could also end with your e-mail address. just copy all the code including
the email)

click on add and you are done!
