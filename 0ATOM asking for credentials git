It could happen that Atom asks always for the credentials

this happens because the connection is made with https instead of ssh (that is more secure)



To solve this you first have to setup your ssh connection to your github

to do that follow the instructions on 'SSH Settings'

after doing that you can clone your repositories choosing SSH in the github repo webpage

the problem will be fixed

If you have some repositories that still work with 'https' protocol
e.g. the ones cloned before the implementing of the ssh keys
you can manually switch the remot urls from 'https' to 'ssh'

to do that move to your desired repo folder

then list your existing remote in order to get the name of the remote you want to change:

git remote -v

you will see something:

> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

you know that you have to change them. They should become:

> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git (push)

to change the remote url from https to ssh use 'git remote set-url'command in this way:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git

where git@github.com stays the same no matter the username or the repo
replace USERNAME with your username in github (NOT the e-mail but the Username)
replace also REPOSITORY with the name of your repo remembering that the repo
cannot have spaces in the name.
It will always end also with '.git'

press enter

then you can verify with the command as before:

git remote -v

DONE!
